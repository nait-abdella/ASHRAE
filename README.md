#### DonnÃ©es:

The data contains 3 files: 

* train : de taille (20216100, 4)
* building_meta : de taille (1449, 6)
* weather_train : de taille (139773, 9) 


First, we have **merged** the files to have a single file that we called train.
The size of the train file is: (20216100, 16).

Then, we have **reduced the memory** of the data:

* Memory usage of dataframe was: 2622.02 MB
* Memory usage after optimization: 790.84 MB

=> Decreased by 69.8%
